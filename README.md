# Org Report Whistleblower Site

__Disclaimer__: It should be noted that this is not an actually reporting site. None of the reports or data used is real. This is a class project.

__Scrum Master:__ Jacob Wald

__Description__: As the scrum master for this group project, I lead each sprint, deciding which work needed to get accomplished, and who was to do each task. I also worked extensively on the styling of the site, the initialization of the project, the nav bar, the routing (controler), the report page, and the site admin page.
